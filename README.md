This is what the questionscrambler does: It takes questions out of a questionsfile, scrambles their order and puts them in a Latex compilable .tex-file.//
Python and Latex need to be installed on your system in order to perform the code generation and compilation afterwards.//
Please be aware that you have to adapt the graphics path in ./templates/document_begin.tex and put a subject of testing to create the documents.
