This is what the questionscrambler does: It takes questions out of a questionsfile, scrambles their order and puts them in a Latex compilable .tex-file.
Python and LAtex need to be installed on your system in order to perdorm the code generation and compilation afterwards.
Please place a picture with the name europe.jpg in your home-directory and adapt Line 19 in ./templates/document_begin.tex in order to have a successful compilation.
